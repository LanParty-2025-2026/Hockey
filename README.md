# Game Hockey
This game is inspired by https://www.friv.com/z/games/socceronline/game.html 
The goal is to implement this game in a major game called 'lan party'

# Menu scene

When you choose a flag, there's an outline for a visual feedback.
After choosing the flag you're playing with, you just have to press 
the play button.

# Actual game
The scene is called Game.
I drawed all the field by myself, so all of the vertical / horizontal lines and also the circles.
TODO: maybe add a pretty pattern to the grass, so it's smoother.
I putted all of the lines on level 1, so the grass is level 0, the lines level 1 and then
the other things, like the ball, player will have their own level.
